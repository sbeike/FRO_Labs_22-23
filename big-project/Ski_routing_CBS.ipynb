Each town has $d_i$ students and must be visited exactly once by one of the buses.\n",

        "The school has a total of $k$ teachers (one per bus). Each day, some teachers (not necessarily all $k$ of them) will drive a bus to pickup all students. When an instructor is not driving a bus, he must be picked up by one of the other buses. The ski school pays a fixed daily fee for each instructor that drives a bus, equivalent to the distance between his hometown and the school.\n",
        "\n",
        "To ensure efficient transportation, a bus visiting a town must pick up all of its students, and the total number of students picked up by each bus must not exceed its capacity. Additionally, it is mandatory for each bus to start and end its route at the ski school.\n",
